# Unminify
[Link Challenge](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/426)
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Just Inspect and you'll find the flag

```
<div class="picoctf{}" style="width:70%">
    <p class="picoctf{}">If you're reading this, your browser has succesfully received the flag.</p>
    <p class="picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_b99eb82e}"></p>
    <p class="picoctf{}">I just deliver flags, I don't know how to read them...</p>
</div>
```
